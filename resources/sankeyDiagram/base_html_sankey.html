	<h1>The connection between the housing characteristics and their data sources in ResStock</h1>

	<p class="lead">The probability distributions and the measure inputs are based on different and often multiple data sources. The connection between the housing characteristics and their data sources is portrayed in a Sankey diagram.  A Sankey diagram is a type of flow diagram. In the figure below is a legend where the housing characteristics are on the left and the data source is on the right.  The color of the housing characteristic indicates the category to identify which categories of housing characteristics came from which data sources.</p>
