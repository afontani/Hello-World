# Housing Characteristics Information

This file provides information about all of the housing characteristics and their dependencies and options used in this project of ResStock.  The information is compiled from the `resources/housing_characteristic_info.json` file in a more readable format.

## Visualization of the Housing Characteristic Dependencies

ResStock is built upon the conditional probabilites of the housing characteristics.  Each housing characteristic has a set of dependencies and dependants.  An interactive dependency and dependents visualization is provided in the links below:

## Visualization of the Housing Characteristics and Their Corresponding Data Sources

the creating of each housing characteristics' probability distribution and their measure inputs are based on multiple data sources. To visualize these connections use the link below.
